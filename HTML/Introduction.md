# Introduction
### What is HTML?
- **HTML** stands for **Hyper Text Markup Language**.
- It is the **standard markup language** used for creating **web pages**.
- HTML defines the **structure** of a web page.
- It is made up of a series of **elements**.
- HTML elements instruct the browser on how to **display content**.

### HTML Attributes
- Every **HTML element** can have **attributes**.
- Attributes offer **extra details** about elements.
- They are always defined within the **opening tag**.
- Attributes are typically written as **name/value pairs**, such as: `name="value"`.

#### Absolute URL
- An **absolute URL** links to an image hosted on a different website. For example: `src="https://www.example.com/images/sample.jpg"`.
  
  **Note**: External images may be copyrighted. Using them without permission could violate copyright laws. Also, you cannot control these images, and they might be removed or altered without notice.

#### Relative URL
- A **relative URL** links to an image hosted within the same website. The URL doesn't include the domain name. If it starts without a slash, it's relative to the current page. For example: `src="images/sample.jpg"`. If the URL starts with a slash, it's relative to the root domain. Example: `src="/assets/images/sample.jpg"`.

  **Tip**: It's usually better to use relative URLs because they remain intact even if the domain changes.

#### HTML Element Attributes
- All **HTML elements** can have **attributes**.
- The **href** attribute in the `<a>` tag specifies the **URL** the link points to.
- The **src** attribute in the `<img>` tag defines the **path** to the image to be shown.
- The **width** and **height** attributes in the `<img>` tag specify the **dimensions** of the image.
- The **alt** attribute in the `<img>` tag provides **alternative text** for the image if it cannot be displayed.
- The **style** attribute is used to apply **CSS styles** to an element, such as **color**, **font**, **size**, and more.
- The **lang** attribute in the `<html>` tag indicates the **language** of the webpage.
- The **title** attribute offers **additional information** about an element.
