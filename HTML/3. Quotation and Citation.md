### HTML Quotation and Citation Elements

In this chapter, we will cover the `<blockquote>, <q>, <abbr>, <address>, <cite>, and <bdo>` HTML tags.

**Example**  
Hereâ€™s a quote from the famous author George Orwell:

"War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength."

----------

### HTML `<blockquote>` for Quotations

The `<blockquote>` element in HTML is used to define a section that is quoted from another source.  
Browsers typically indent the `<blockquote>` element.

**Example**

`<p>`Here is a quote from George Orwell's *1984*:`</p>` `<blockquote cite="https://www.george-orwell.org/1984">` "War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength." `</blockquote>`

----------

### HTML `<q>` for Short Quotations

The `<q>` tag in HTML is used for short quotations.  
Browsers typically place quotation marks around the quoted text.

**Example**

`<p>`In his famous novel, Orwell states: `<q>`Freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.`</q></p>`

----------

### HTML `<abbr>` for Abbreviations

The `<abbr>` tag in HTML defines an abbreviation or acronym, such as "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", or "ATM".  
Marking abbreviations can provide helpful information to browsers, translation tools, and search engines.

**Tip**: Use the global title attribute to display a description of the abbreviation or acronym when hovering over the element.

**Example**

`<p>`The `<abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">`NASA`</abbr>` was established in 1958.`</p>`

----------

### HTML `<address>` for Contact Information

The `<address>` tag in HTML is used to define the contact information for the author or owner of a document or article.  
This could include an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, or social media handle.  
Text within the `<address>` element is typically italicized, and browsers automatically insert line breaks before and after the element.

**Example**

`<address>` Written by Sarah Lee.`<br>` Visit us at:`<br>` www.exampleblog.com`<br>` 123 Blog Street`<br>` New York, NY 10001`<br>` USA `</address>`

----------

### HTML `<cite>` for Work Title

The `<cite>` tag in HTML defines the title of a creative work, such as a book, poem, song, movie, painting, or sculpture.  
Note: A person's name is not considered the title of a work.  
Text inside the `<cite>` element is usually italicized.

**Example**

`<p><cite>`The Great Gatsby`</cite>` by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Published in 1925.`</p>`

----------

### HTML `<bdo>` for Bi-Directional Override

BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override.  
The `<bdo>` tag is used to override the current text direction.

**Example**  
`<bdo dir="rtl">`dlrow olleh`</bdo>` (This text is written from right to left)
